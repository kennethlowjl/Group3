# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.*

Our team has been working well together and we cater to each others needs. When a problem arises, we aim to settle it immediately. Every team member has their weakness and forte so we delegate the tasks based on who can best perform it instead of splitting it equally as we feel that this method will create a more cohesive and efficient environment. We make sure to get inputs from all team members and ensure that all of us agree before finalizing on any ideas. For example, when we have a few ideas, we list the advantages and disadvantages of each of the ideas and make a decision from there.

*Discuss the scrum meetings, and what could make them more efficient (if anything).*

The scrum meetings will be scheduled on a day when it is convienient for everyone. During scrum meetings, we discuss on how we can progress better and how to better manage our work. 

*Highlight any communication issues that might be affecting the project.*

*If standup meetings were used, then include a Jira link, and discuss their effectiveness.*

## Sprint Burndown Charts

*In this section include a screenshot of a sprint-burndown chart for each of your completed sprints.*

*For each sprint, include links to the standup meetings (recorded on Jira, hopefully) associated with each sprint.*

## Burndown-Charts Discussion
*Add a discussion of what the burndown charts indicate, and how your team might improve their velocity / estimation ability in future sprints.*

## Product Backlog
*Include here a screenshot of your current product backlog.*

## Other Areas
*If your team has anything else they want to demonstrate, e.g. advanced project management tools, reporting graphs with suitable explanation and interpretation, advanced use of Jira (e.g. issue links, epics, versions), or continuous integration tools, then include a summary here.*
